      * Text Editor - Open by double clicking on any of the files to open in a text editor.

  #### AppSettings

  1) Create a new file in the LocalBusiness.Solution/LocalBusiness directory named `appsettings.json`
  2) Add in the following code snippet to the new appsettings.json file:
  
  ```
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning"
        }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=local_business;uid=root;pwd=YourPassword;"
    }

  2) Run the command `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database through Entity Framework Core.
  3) (Optional) To update the database with any changes to the code, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationsName>` which will use Entity Framework Core's code-first principle to generate a database update. After, run the previous command `dotnet ef database update` to update the database.

  #### Launch the API
  1) Navigate to LocalBusiness.Solution/LocalBusiness directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell.
  2) Run the command `dotnet run` to have access to the API in Postman or browser.

------------------------------

## üõ∞Ô∏è API Documentation
Explore the API endpoints in Postman or a browser. You will not be able to utilize authentication in a browser.

### Using Swagger Documentation 
To explore the Local Business API with NSwag, launch the project using `dotnet run` with the Terminal or Powershell, and input the following URL into your browser: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

### Using the JSON Web Token
In order to be authorized to use the POST, PUT, DELETE functionality of the API, please authenticate yourself through Postman.
* Open Postman and create a POST request using the URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/users/authenticate`
* Add the following query to the request as raw data in the Body tab:
```
{
    "UserName": "test",
    "Password": "test"
}
```
* The token will be generated in the response. Copy and paste it as the Token paramenter in the Authorization tab.

<!-- ### Note on Pagination
The Cretaceous Park API returns a default of 2 results per page at a time.

To modify this, use the query parameters `limit` and `start` to alter the response results displayed. The `limit` parameter will specify how many results will be displayed, and the `start` parameter will specify which element in the response the limit should start counting. -->
